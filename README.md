<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

Have you ever been stuck in traffic and thought to yourself, "If other people drove better, I wouldn't be here?" Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg, two German physicists, made a fundamental breakthrough in understanding and modeling the emergence of traffic jams. As it turns out, traffic jams are not random occurrences; rather, they are highly predictable.

# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.
